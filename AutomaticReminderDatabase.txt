# 	Example for first format:  Thursday, June 22, 2015
# 	Example for second format: Thursday, September 3, 2015	

# The following are appended to each line (with ';' between them) after each reminder is sent:
# Sent a 1-week-to-go reminder
# Sent a 2-day-to-go reminder
# Sent a 1-day-to-go reminder
# Sent a today reminder

# Thursday, June 22, 2015; LastName1 FirstName1; Sent a 1-week-to-go reminder; Sent a 2-day-to-go reminder
